[i wanna find out some interesting technical problems people have faced when...](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-wanna-find-out-some-interest-oll6n_wqR6GWnqL8R2fboQ)

- button debouncing circuit/code
- make the GPIO pin sense touch
- control a servo using a joystick, but the joystick should add and subtract from the position of the servo, not set the position ([Circuit design servo control - Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hWg4q6TL2Gd/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard))(took half an hour to make)
- 5 LEDs and a switch -they turn on from 0 to 5 when switch is flipped, but then from 5 to 0 when switch is turned off again ([Circuit design Sizzling Crift - Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lHAs6exrSnM/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard))(half an hour)
	- why shouldnt you use 0 and 1 pin of arduino in certain codes
	- how did i make this button work without using a pulldown or pullup resistor
	- use a button like a switch
	- why use ! and not ~

- common grounding

- LED blinking without using an arduino (first make them use an arduino, and then tell them to make something without an arduino)
- capacitor charge/discharge visualization
- a binary up counter


- there's also communication protocols, but without a second Arduino it would feel kinda pointless, im thinking we'll tell them to bring their arduinos, and two people connect your arduinos and make them communicate using UART, I2C and SPI


- how to use a multimeter
