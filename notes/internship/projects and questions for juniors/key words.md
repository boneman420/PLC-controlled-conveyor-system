[i wanna find out some interesting technical problems people have faced when...](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-wanna-find-out-some-interest-oll6n_wqR6GWnqL8R2fboQ)

- button debouncing circuit/code
- make the GPIO pin sense touch
- control a servo using a joystick, but the joystick should add and subtract from the position of the servo, not set the position ([Circuit design servo control - Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hWg4q6TL2Gd/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard))(took half an hour to make)



- LED blinking without using an arduino (first make them use an arduino, and then tell them to make something without an arduino)
- capacitor charge/discharge visualization
- a binary up counter
