the job i have here is simple

yes he did ask me to add a carousel and shi -but i think i should make a stable working version before i add a carousel, divider and all the extra stuff

i have to work on the stop condition still, the dieback condition, and the HMI integration

and i also have to work on the GUI thing he was showing

i shouldnt overcomplicate this for myself

------------------
the motor fault condition will activate if the motor is on but there's no running feedback
