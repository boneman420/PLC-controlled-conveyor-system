today all i did was make this. i have no made much progress today

i think im stuck up on making a full system

i think the U shaped system was enough to first implement all the features and make sure they're working

i gotta implement die back condition and HMI in that system -only then can i make this larger system

i wasted time in renaming all the conveyors, ihml
