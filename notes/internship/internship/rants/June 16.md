remember the table from june 5?
we now add low power mode as an input to that table

| low power mode | system start/stop memory | conveyors running | all conveyors running | system start | system stop |

Input Definitions:
- `A` = system start/stop memory
- `B` = conveyors running
- `C` = all conveyors running
- `D` = low power mode ‚Üê new input
We'll rederive expressions for:
- `F` = system start
- `Q` = system start blink
- `S` = system stop
- `T` = system stop blink


***(the below table is wrong. need to redo it)***
