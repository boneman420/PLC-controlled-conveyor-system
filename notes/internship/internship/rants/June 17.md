We'll rederive expressions for:
- `F` = system start
- `Q` = system start blink
- `S` = system stop
- `T` = system stop blink

lamp control logic:
- inputs: system start stop memory,
		all conveyors running,
		conveyors running,
		low power mode,
		fault flag
- outputs: start, fault, stop

conveyor control logic:
- in start condition:
	- inputs: (clearance delay off: belt delay, succeeding conveyor running feedback)
	- outputs: delay
- in low power condition:
	- inputs: (sensor control: belt delay, preceding sensor)
	- outputs: %% delay %%
- in stop condition:
	- inputs: (sensor control: belt delay, preceding sensor), (clearance delay off: belt delay, preceding conveyor running feedback), low power mode
	- outputs: delay
- in fault condition:
	- inputs: (sensor control: belt delay, preceding sensor), succeeding conveyor fault feedback out
	- outputs: delay

so each conveyor has a sensor control block and a timer block before enable
